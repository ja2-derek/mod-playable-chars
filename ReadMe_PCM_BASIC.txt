Playable characters mod for ja2 and ja2 1.13 Version 0.95 BASIC				by The_Scorpion


features of the BASIC version:

turned the ja2 characters Darrell, Perko, Maria, Skyrider, Fred Morriss, John Kulba, Matt Duncan, Calvin Barkmore and Carl Tercel into playable characters

All new playable characters have faces, speech and battlesounds, they also have character skills. They're free of charge.

changes are very un-intrusive as to the intergrity of the vanilla story, setting, maps etc.


Notes:

Skyrider has his speech limited due to an overlapping issue from his function as a pilot. If the player prefers to have skyrider as the pilot (as in the vanilla game),
he has a window of opportunity. After Skyrider is escorted to his chopper, he'll do his usual speech, then skyrider will walk towars his chopper

If you want to avoid skyrider to join the squad but want him as a pilot as usual, go to the strategic map before skyrider has finished his way to the chopper. Then everything will be as usual.
If you want him to join, wait for him to reach his chopper, he'll then turn playable.

John and Darrell will be automatically added to the player's squad. If you don't want them, you can just dismiss them

Darrell will only join if a female character is married to the Hicks. This function is flawed under the 2322 exe and will lead to a assertion failure. If you want to use Darrell,
use the RR 2124 exe instead. There might still be issues with this action related to 1.13's messed pathing. Make sure your female character has a path to the place where darrell is walking
to. If she doen't move, break the deadlock using alt-enter and make her walk into that direction, the pathing might still catch her and continue her script.

Perko can just be recruited, but need an active player input (click on "recruit")

Maria, automatically joins the squad after having met Angel. like skryider, there's some time between the end of the quest and her joining the squad. After having talked to angel,
maria will leave the leather shop and, once standing on the road, join the player's squad. In that time between end of quest (history log beeps) and her joining, the player can go to the strategic screen
if he doesn't want Maria to join the squad.

Fred Morris as a head miner can only be recruited after the mine he leads has started to produce income for the player

Upon recruiting, he loses parts of his head minr function, parts might still be active and overlap
For convenience reason, it is advised to minimise the chances that the mining income is interruptet (either the bug quest is already over, or sci-fi mode is unselected) in oder not to cause glitches
For testing, he can however join as soon as the mine has started to produce income. Please report any glitches that appear in this situation.


Non Basic versions

Non Basic versions will include more characters. 
Non Basic versions versions might or might not receive some extra features. My policy is to keep the mod as modular as possible, so ther might be different variations in the future.
